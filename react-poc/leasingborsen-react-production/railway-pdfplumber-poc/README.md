# Railway Processing Service

This is a FastAPI service deployed on Railway that provides PDF text extraction and image processing capabilities for the Leasingb√∏rsen React application.

## Service Endpoints

### Health & Monitoring
- `GET /` - Health check with feature list
- `GET /health` - Simple health status
- `GET /cache/stats` - Image cache statistics

### PDF Processing
- `POST /extract/structured` - Extract structured text from PDF files

### Image Processing (NEW)
- `POST /process-image` - Process car images with:
  - Background removal (via API4.ai)
  - Auto-cropping to remove transparent padding
  - Drop shadow effects
  - Multiple size generation (grid, detail, full)
  - In-memory caching for performance

## Usage

### PDF Extraction
The main React application calls this service at `https://leasingborsen-production.up.railway.app/extract/structured` to extract text from uploaded PDF files before sending the text to AI processing.

### Image Processing
```json
POST /process-image
{
  "image_base64": "base64_encoded_image",
  "filename": "car.jpg",
  "options": {
    "remove_background": true,
    "auto_crop": true,
    "add_shadow": true,
    "create_sizes": true
  }
}
```
