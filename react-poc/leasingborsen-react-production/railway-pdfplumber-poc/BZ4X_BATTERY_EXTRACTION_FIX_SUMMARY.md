# BZ4X Battery Extraction Fix - Summary

## Problem Description

The unique variant ID generation was producing malformed IDs for BZ4X electric vehicles:

**Before Fix:**
- ID: `bz4x_active_,_hk_167hp` ❌
- Missing battery capacity (57.7 kWh)
- Malformed comma artifacts

**After Fix:**
- ID: `bz4x_active_167hp_57_7kwh_electric` ✅
- Contains battery capacity
- Clean format without artifacts

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Variant Name Duplication
**Problem:** BZ4X variants contained engine specifications that duplicated information from the `engine_specification` field.

- **Variant:** "Active 57.7 Kwh, 167 Hk"
- **Engine Spec:** "57.7 kWh, 167 hk"
- **Result:** Duplication in ID generation

### Issue 2: Malformed Comma Processing
When the variant name contained commas and technical specifications, the ID generation would create malformed patterns like `,_hk` in the final ID.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix 1: BZ4X Variant Standardization
Modified `_standardize_variant_name()` in `extract_with_template.py`:

```python
# BZ4X - Variant = Trimline only (clean approach for unique ID generation)
elif model == "BZ4X":
    # Extract just the trimline from variants like "Active 57.7 Kwh, 167 Hk"
    # Remove battery and power info since that's already in engine_specification
    trimline = original_variant
    
    # Remove battery specifications: "57.7 Kwh", "73.1 Kwh", etc.
    trimline = re.sub(r'\s+\d+[.,]\d*\s*[Kk][Ww][Hh].*', '', trimline).strip()
    
    # Remove power specifications: "167 Hk", "224 Hk", "343 Hk", etc.
    trimline = re.sub(r'\s+\d+\s*[Hh][Kk].*', '', trimline).strip()
    
    # Remove any trailing commas or punctuation
    trimline = re.sub(r'[,\s]+$', '', trimline).strip()
    
    # For BZ4X, use ONLY the clean trimline as variant for ID generation
    # This prevents duplication in the ID generation process
    item["variant"] = trimline
```

### Fix 2: Battery Extraction from Engine Specification
The `extract_battery_capacity()` function correctly extracts battery information from the `engine_specification` field, not from the variant name.

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
Variant: "Active 57.7 Kwh, 167 Hk"
Engine Spec: "57.7 kWh, 167 hk"
Generated ID: "bz4x_active_,_hk_167hp" ❌
```

### After Fix
```
Original Variant: "Active 57.7 Kwh, 167 Hk"
Standardized Variant: "Active"
Engine Spec: "57.7 kWh, 167 hk"
Generated ID: "bz4x_active_167hp_57_7kwh_electric" ✅
```

## Verification Results

✅ **Battery Extraction:** 57.7 kWh correctly extracted from engine specification  
✅ **Power Extraction:** 167 hp correctly extracted  
✅ **ID Format:** Clean format without malformed commas  
✅ **Uniqueness:** Each unique car configuration gets a unique ID  
✅ **No Regression:** Other Toyota models (AYGO X, YARIS, etc.) unaffected  

### All BZ4X Test Cases Pass

| Original Variant | Standardized | Generated ID |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| "Active 57.7 Kwh, 167 Hk" | "Active" | `bz4x_active_167hp_57_7kwh_electric` |
| "Executive 73.1 Kwh, 224 Hk" | "Executive" | `bz4x_executive_224hp_73_1kwh_electric` |
| "Executive Panorama 73.1 Kwh, 343 Hk AWD" | "Executive Panorama" | `bz4x_executive_panorama_343hp_73_1kwh_awd_electric` |

## Files Modified

1. **`extract_with_template.py`** - Line 1075-1092
   - Modified BZ4X variant standardization logic
   - Changed from concatenating trimline + engine_spec to using only clean trimline

## Impact Assessment

- ✅ **Fixes malformed IDs** for BZ4X electric vehicles
- ✅ **Preserves unique identification** for each car configuration
- ✅ **No breaking changes** to other Toyota models
- ✅ **Clean, readable ID format** for all BZ4X variants
- ✅ **Battery capacity correctly included** in IDs (57_7kwh format)

## Deployment Ready

The fix has been thoroughly tested and is ready for deployment to Railway. The BZ4X battery extraction issue has been resolved, and IDs will now show the correct format:

**Expected ID Format:** `bz4x_active_167hp_57_7kwh_electric`  
**Instead of:** `bz4x_active_,_hk_167hp`
