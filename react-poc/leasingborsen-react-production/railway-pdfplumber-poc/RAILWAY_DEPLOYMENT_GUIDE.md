# Railway Deployment Guide - Finding the File Editor

## üîç How to Find Railway File Editor

### Step 1: Access Your Railway Project
1. Go to **railway.app** in your browser
2. Log in to your Railway account
3. Find your **Toyota PDF extraction project** in your dashboard

### Step 2: Navigate to File Editor
**Option A: Through Project Dashboard**
1. Click on your project name
2. Look for tabs at the top: **Overview**, **Deployments**, **Variables**, **Settings**
3. Look for **"Source"** or **"Code"** tab
4. This should open the file browser/editor

**Option B: Through Service View**
1. In your project, click on the **service name** (usually shows as your app name)
2. Look for **"Source"** or **"Files"** in the service view
3. This opens the code editor

**Option C: GitHub Integration (if connected)**
1. If your Railway project is connected to GitHub
2. You might see **"View on GitHub"** or **"Repository"** links
3. The files might be editable through GitHub integration

### Step 3: What to Look For
The file editor should show:
- üìÅ **File browser** on the left side
- üìù **Code editor** on the right side
- Files like: `app.py`, `extract_with_template.py`, `requirements.txt`, etc.

## üîÑ Alternative Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Railway CLI Installation
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway deploy
```

### Method 2: GitHub Connection
If your Railway project is connected to GitHub:
1. The files will automatically deploy when you push to GitHub
2. We need to fix the git authentication issue first

### Method 3: Direct File Upload
Some Railway interfaces allow:
1. **Drag & drop** files directly
2. **Upload** button for individual files
3. **Import from GitHub** option

## üéØ Files That Need to Be Updated

You need to update these 2 files in Railway:

### 1. `extract_with_template.py`
- **Size**: ~60KB
- **Contains**: All the Toyota extraction logic
- **Key Changes**: Enhanced deduplication and unique ID generation

### 2. `toyota-template-config.json`
- **Size**: ~8KB  
- **Contains**: Configuration for Toyota PDF extraction
- **Key Change**: Line 182 duplicate removal configuration

## üÜò If You Can't Find File Editor

**Contact Options:**
1. **Railway Support**: Check Railway documentation or support chat
2. **Alternative**: Share your Railway project URL structure so I can provide more specific guidance
3. **Backup Plan**: Install Railway CLI for command-line deployment

## ‚úÖ Quick Test After Deployment

Once files are updated:
1. Go to your Toyota PDF processing page in admin
2. Upload the same Toyota PDF
3. Should show: **"Successfully extracted 28 Toyota variants"**
4. Should show: **No duplicate ID errors**

The fixes are ready - we just need to get them deployed to Railway!
