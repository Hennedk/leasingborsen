# Session Handoff: Extraction DELETE Fix Implementation

## Session Summary (January 2025)

This session successfully resolved critical DELETE operation failures in the extraction changes system that were preventing proper cleanup of outdated listings.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Database Function Issues
- **Problem**: "column reference 'existing_listing_id' is ambiguous"
- **Solution**: Renamed variable to `v_existing_listing_id` throughout the function
- **File**: Database function `apply_selected_extraction_changes`

### 2. Resolved Foreign Key Constraint Violations
- **Problem**: Multiple `extraction_listing_changes` referencing same listing blocked deletion
- **Solution**: Updated DELETE logic to clear ALL references (removed session-specific exclusion)
- **Impact**: Listings can now be deleted even with references from other sessions

### 3. Fixed Toyota bZ4X Duplicate Creation
- **Problem**: Same vehicle with different transmissions created duplicates
- **Solution**: Removed transmission from `generateExactKey` function (now 3 parameters)
- **Files**: 
  - `supabase/functions/compare-extracted-listings/index.ts`
  - `src/services/comparison/comparison-utils.ts`

### 4. Created Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Location**: `src/services/extraction/__tests__/`
- **Coverage**: DELETE operations, foreign key scenarios, Toyota matching logic
- **Commands**: `npm run test:extraction`

## Verified Working Operations

1. Successfully deleted listing `22bf5261-322a-47c7-afe0-4e3872841f4b` from session `290915a6-0fc9-4da7-b1c6-1ebd3c86becf`
2. Successfully deleted listing `dd943a4d-7e93-49dc-b351-59d924218304` in staging environment
3. Toyota bZ4X no longer creates duplicates when transmission differs

## Important Behavioral Change

⚠️ **WARNING**: The deletion logic no longer restricts by model. When uploading partial inventories:
- **Before**: Only unmatched listings of extracted models were marked for deletion
- **After**: ALL unmatched listings from the dealer are marked for deletion
- **Impact**: Always review extraction results carefully before applying changes

## For New Sessions

### Essential Files to Review
1. `src/services/extraction/__tests__/README.md` - Complete context and test overview
2. `docs/archive/EXTRACTION_DELETE_FIX_2025.md` - Detailed technical documentation
3. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with extraction test commands and references

### Test the Fixes
```bash
# Run extraction tests
npm run test:extraction

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:extraction:watch

# View test coverage
npm run test:extraction:coverage
```

### Key Code Changes

**Database Function** (`apply_selected_extraction_changes`):
```sql
-- Variable declaration (fixed)
v_existing_listing_id UUID;  -- Was: existing_listing_id UUID

-- DELETE logic (fixed)
UPDATE extraction_listing_changes 
SET existing_listing_id = NULL
WHERE existing_listing_id = v_existing_listing_id;
-- Removed: AND id != ANY(p_selected_change_ids)
```

**Comparison Logic** (`generateExactKey`):
```typescript
// Before: 4 parameters including transmission
export function generateExactKey(make, model, variant, transmission)

// After: 3 parameters (transmission removed)
export function generateExactKey(make: string, model: string, variant: string): string {
  return `${make}|${model}|${variant}`.toLowerCase();
}
```

## Next Steps

The extraction changes system is now functioning correctly with:
- DELETE operations working reliably
- Foreign key constraints properly handled
- Toyota duplicate prevention implemented
- Comprehensive test coverage in place

No immediate action required unless new issues arise with extraction workflows.
