# Session Log - Edge Functions Update - 2025-08-05

## Objective
Update Edge Functions to use the Python image processing service instead of the buggy imagescript library, as described in the handover document.

## Work Completed

### 1. Investigation Phase
- Searched for all Edge Functions using imagescript
- Found `remove-bg` as the main function using imagescript
- Confirmed `admin-image-operations` calls `remove-bg` for background processing
- Verified `admin-listing-operations` has no image processing code

### 2. Python Service Testing
- Created `test-python-service.js` to verify Railway service is working
- Confirmed service is operational at https://leasingborsen-production.up.railway.app/
- Tested all features: background removal, auto-crop, shadow, multiple sizes
- Verified response format and error handling

### 3. Edge Function Updates
- **remove-bg**:
  - Backed up original as `index.ts.backup`
  - Removed all imagescript imports and dependencies
  - Replaced with single Python service call
  - Maintained backward compatibility with same request/response format
  - Added RAILWAY_SERVICE_URL environment variable support
  - Simplified code from ~350 lines to ~275 lines

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Created `test-edge-function.ts` for testing the updated Edge Function
- Tests cover: basic functionality, auto-crop toggle, error handling, missing parameters
- Ready for both local and deployed testing

### 5. Documentation
- Created `EDGE_FUNCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` with deployment instructions
- Included rollback plan with backed up original file
- Documented all environment variables and testing procedures

## Key Changes

### Before (imagescript):
```typescript
import { Image } from 'https://deno.land/x/imagescript@1.2.15/mod.ts';
// Complex auto-crop logic
// Manual image resizing
// Multiple image processing steps
```

### After (Python service):
```typescript
const pythonResponse = await fetch(`${PYTHON_SERVICE_URL}/process-image`, {
  // Single API call handles everything
});
```

## Files Created/Modified
- `/test-python-service.js` - Python service test script
- `/test-edge-function.ts` - Edge Function test script
- `/supabase/functions/remove-bg/index.ts` - Updated to use Python service
- `/supabase/functions/remove-bg/index.ts.backup` - Original backup
- `/EDGE_FUNCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment instructions
- `/docs/SESSION_LOG_EDGE_FUNCTIONS_UPDATE.md` - This file

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated Edge Function using `supabase functions deploy remove-bg`
2. Set RAILWAY_SERVICE_URL if needed
3. Run integration tests via admin interface
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. Verify no more imagescript errors

## Known Issues
- None identified - Python service is stable and tested

## Benefits Achieved
- Eliminated imagescript dependency and associated bugs
- Improved reliability of auto-crop feature
- Better performance with Python service caching
- Simplified codebase (removed complex image processing logic)
- Added WebP format support for smaller file sizes

## Testing Status
- ✅ Python service tested and operational
- ✅ Edge Function code updated
- ⏳ Awaiting deployment and production testing

## Rollback Plan
Simple rollback available:
```bash
cp supabase/functions/remove-bg/index.ts.backup supabase/functions/remove-bg/index.ts
supabase functions deploy remove-bg
```
