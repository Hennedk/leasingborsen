## Session: 2025-01-10 (Evening) - UI Polish & Component Cleanup

### Summary
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Removed shadow effects, improved mobile filter UI consistency, and cleaned up unused components  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - UI polished, unused code removed, ready for production

### Major Changes Implemented

#### 1. Shadow Removal Across UI
- Removed ALL shadow effects for flatter, cleaner design
- Updated CSS variables to set all shadows to `none`
- Modified Tailwind config to neutralize shadow values
- Updated 51 files total (components, pages, tests)
- Affected: Cards, buttons, dialogs, dropdowns, all UI components

#### 2. Mobile Filter UI Improvements
- **Filter Button**: Removed "Filtre" text, now icon-only for cleaner look
- **Visual Separation**: Added top border to mobile filter bar
- **Typography Consistency**: 
  - Filter headers: Changed from `text-sm` to `text-base`, `font-medium`, `text-foreground`
  - Unified label styling across all filter types
- **Dropdown Styling**: Made sorting dropdown visually consistent with make/model buttons
  - Added `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `font-medium`
  - Applied same styling to price range and seat selects
- **Filter Chips**: Reduced font weight from `font-medium` to `font-normal`

#### 3. Component Cleanup
- **Removed**: `MobileFilterMainView.tsx` (unused alternative implementation)
- **Reason**: Component was never imported, used static config instead of database
- **Kept**: `MobileFilterOverlay` as the single production mobile filter component
- Updated documentation to remove references

#### 4. Data Source Discovery
- Identified dual-source issue for fuel/body types:
  - `MobileFilterOverlay`: Uses database via `useReferenceData` hook (ACTIVE)
  - `MobileFilterMainView`: Used static `FILTER_CONFIG` (REMOVED)
- Database approach is the production implementation
