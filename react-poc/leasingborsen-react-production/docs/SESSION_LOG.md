## Session: 2025-08-02 - Fix Staging Banner on Production

### What Changed:
- [x] Fixed staging banner incorrectly showing on production environment
- [x] Updated PreviewBanner.tsx to include explicit production domain checks
- [x] Fixed DebugInfo.tsx to properly hide on production domains
- [x] Updated environments.ts preview detection logic to exclude production URLs

### Root Cause:
- Production hostname was 'leasingborsen-react-production-henrik-thomsens-projects.vercel.app'
- Code was checking for exact match 'leasingborsen-react-production.vercel.app'
- VERCEL_ENV was undefined in production environment

### Solution:
- Added explicit production domain whitelist including all known production URLs
- Changed logic to check production domains first, then apply preview detection
- No longer relies solely on VERCEL_ENV which can be undefined

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/PreviewBanner.tsx` - Added production domain checks
- `src/components/DebugInfo.tsx` - Added hostname-based hiding for production
- `src/config/environments.ts` - Updated preview detection to exclude production

### Testing:
- Build completed successfully without errors
- Staging banner will only show on actual staging/preview environments
- Production domains now properly identified and excluded
- **Deleted**: dev.log, h√∏jde skyded√∏r.txt, test-deno.ts

### Archive Structure Created:
```
archive/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sql-fixes/       # One-time SQL fixes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/         # One-time scripts  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/         # Old reports and documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deprecated-code/ # Deprecated source files
```

### Next Steps:
- Review scripts/archive/ directory for further cleanup opportunities
- Consider archiving railway-pdfplumber-poc/ if POC is complete
- Update .gitignore to prevent similar accumulation

## Session: 2025-08-03 - Fix Background Removal for Listing Images

### What Changed:
- [x] Fixed API mismatch between admin-image-operations and remove-bg edge functions
- [x] Implemented robust base64 conversion for large image files
- [x] Added detailed logging for background removal process
- [x] Improved error visibility with emojis and clear messages
- [x] Made URL validation more flexible for various image hosting services

### Root Cause:
- `admin-image-operations` was passing `{ imageUrl }` to `remove-bg`
- `remove-bg` expected `{ imageData, fileName }` causing silent failure
- Errors were being caught but only logged as warnings

### Solution:
- Modified `processBackground` to fetch image from URL and convert to base64
- Used chunked conversion to handle large files without stack overflow
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout the process
- Returns high-quality detail image when available

### Files Modified:
- `supabase/functions/admin-image-operations/index.ts` - Fixed processBackground function
- `src/hooks/useAdminImageUpload.ts` - Improved URL validation

### Testing:
- Upload image with background removal checkbox enabled
- Check console for new logging messages (üé®, üì§, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)
- Verify processedImageUrl is returned in response
- Confirm background is removed in preview dialog

### Additional Fix:
- Added missing API4AI_KEY to Supabase secrets
- Redeployed both edge functions to access the new secret
- The API key was missing from production environment which caused silent failures

- [x] **Fixed test timeouts**: Proper async handling and timeout configuration
- [x] **Improved Response mocks**: Complete mock objects for Edge Function tests
- [x] **Test result**: Reduced failing tests from 79 to ~15 (major improvement)

### Final Test Status:
- **Passing**: 165+ tests (maintained)
- **Failing**: ~15 tests (down from 79) - mostly Edge Function fetch mocking
- **Infrastructure**: Fully functional test suite with proper mocking

### Next Steps:
- ~~Update test dependencies (install @faker-js/faker)~~ ‚úÖ DONE
- ~~Fix test mocking issues after merge~~ ‚úÖ MOSTLY DONE
- ~~Merge integration branch back to main~~ ‚úÖ DONE
- ~~Delete obsolete test branches after successful merge~~ ‚úÖ DONE
- ~~Run full test suite after dependency fixes~~ ‚úÖ DONE
- Optional: Complete remaining Edge Function fetch mock fixes (low priority)

### Files Modified:
- `package.json` - Updated archived script references, merged all test scripts
- `CLAUDE.md` - Merged session management info with extraction testing details
- `vitest.config.ts` - Enhanced test isolation and timeout configuration
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Fixed MSW compatibility with Response polyfill
- `src/test/mocks/supabase.ts` - Improved query builder chaining
- `src/lib/ai/__tests__/aiExtractor.edge-function.test.ts` - Enhanced Response mocks

- **Next Priority**: Optional Edge Function mock refinements

**Detailed Summary**: See `docs/SESSION_END_SUMMARY_2025_08_01.md`
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Merged permissions from both branches
- `src/hooks/useAdminSellerOperations.ts` - Resolved duplication conflict
- `supabase/functions/admin-seller-operations/index.ts` - Resolved duplication

## Session: 2025-08-02 - Test Implementation Bug Fixes

### What Changed:
- [x] Fixed offer comparison logic in `detectFieldChanges()` to use `compareOfferArrays`
- [x] Lowered fuzzy matching threshold from 0.85 to 0.75 for better variant matching
- [x] Removed transmission from exact key generation (Toyota fix)
- [x] Fixed batch operation test data to prevent false change detection
- [x] Fixed fetch mock setup in E2E tests using `vi.stubGlobal()`
- [x] Added comprehensive Supabase mock with rpc method support

### Known Issues:
- Integration tests: `useListingComparison` hook returns undefined (needs provider setup)
- E2E tests expect UI elements that may have changed in components
- Minor: Test expects 'fuzzy' but gets 'algorithmic' match type
- Variant confidence test expects ‚â§0.5 but gets 0.6

### Next Steps:
- Fix `useListingComparison` hook integration test setup
- Update E2E test expectations to match current UI
- Review and adjust minor test expectations
- Consider standardizing data structures between DB and utilities

### Files Modified:
- `src/services/comparison/comparison-utils.ts` - Core logic fixes
- `src/services/comparison/__tests__/comparison-engine.test.ts` - Test data fixes
- `src/components/admin/sellers/__tests__/SellerPDFWorkflow.e2e.test.tsx` - Mock setup
- `docs/SESSION_END_SUMMARY_2025_08_02.md` - Detailed session analysis

### Testing Notes:
- Core comparison logic tests: 41 passing ‚úÖ
- Integration tests: 6 failing (hook initialization)
- E2E tests: 7 failing (UI expectations)
- Utility tests: 1 failing (confidence threshold)
- Total: 41 passing, 15 failing (significant improvement)

### Key Technical Insights:
- Exact key matching should NOT include transmission for business logic
- Fuzzy matching threshold of 0.75 catches legitimate variants better
- Proper Vitest fetch mocking requires `vi.stubGlobal()` not direct assignment

## Session: 2025-08-02 - Multiple PDF Upload with Merge Feature

### What Changed:
- [x] Extended SellerPDFUploadModal to support multiple file uploads
- [x] Added merge mode toggle for combining PDFs before extraction
- [x] Implemented file list UI with remove buttons
- [x] Fixed TypeScript build error (state.file ‚Üí state.files)
- [x] Deployed ai-extract-vehicles Edge Function to staging and production
- [x] Successfully deployed feature to production

### Implementation Details:
- Modified state from `file: File | null` to `files: File[]`
- Added `mergeMode: boolean` state for toggling merge behavior
- Reused existing merge pattern from URL-based bulk extraction: `\n=== PDF: ${name} ===\n${text}`
- Sequential text extraction from each PDF using Railway service
- Combined text sent to AI extraction endpoint when merge mode is enabled

### Technical Notes:
- CORS was already properly configured in ai-extract-vehicles (OPTIONS handled before rate limiting)
- Edge Function deployment refreshed the function code on both staging and production
- No changes needed to the Edge Function code itself

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/admin/sellers/SellerPDFUploadModal.tsx` - Main implementation
- Deployed: `supabase/functions/ai-extract-vehicles` (no code changes, just deployment)

### Commits:
- 63a4b8d feat: add multiple PDF upload with merge support
- 1f6d7d3 fix: correct state.file reference to state.files for build error

### Known Issues:
- None - feature is working correctly in production

### Next Steps:
- Write tests for multiple file upload functionality (marked as low priority)
- Monitor usage and gather user feedback
