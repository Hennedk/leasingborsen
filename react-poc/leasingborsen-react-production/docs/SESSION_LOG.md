## Session: 2025-01-10 - Filter Mapping Fix and Code Cleanup
**Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Main Focus**: Fixed critical fuel type filter bugs and removed unused code

### What Changed
1. **Fixed Fuel Type Filter Mappings** (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
   - Fixed "Benzin" to correctly map to "Petrol" in database (was broken, preventing filtering)
   - Fixed "Hybrid" to map to all variants: "Hybrid - Petrol", "Hybrid - Diesel", "Plug-in - Petrol"
   - Simplified mappings from overly complex patterns to exact database matches

2. **Updated Filter Configuration** (`src/config/filterConfig.ts`)
   - Changed "Electric" label to "Elektrisk" for proper Danish translation
   - Kept all 9 body types including "Mikro" as requested

3. **Fixed Mobile Filter Display** (`src/components/MobileFilterOverlay.tsx`)
   - Changed from using database values to FILTER_CONFIG
   - Now shows same 4 simplified fuel types as desktop (was showing 6+ database values)
   - Applied same fix to body types for consistency

4. **Removed Unused Code**
   - Deleted entire `src/components/mobile-filters/` folder (11 files, ~2000 lines)
   - MobileFilterContainer was never imported or used anywhere
   - Cleaned up redundant implementation

5. **Added Tests** (`src/lib/__tests__/filter-mappings.test.ts`)
   - Comprehensive tests for fuel type mappings
   - Tests for body type consistency
   - Verification of Danish labels

### Known Issues Remaining
- None identified in filter system

### Technical Details
- **Problem**: Desktop filters used hardcoded values that didn't match database (e.g., "Benzin" vs "Petrol")
- **Solution**: Implemented mapping layer in `expandFuelTypes()` function
- **Result**: Users see 4 simple options that correctly query all relevant database records

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Fixed FUEL_TYPE_MAPPING
- `src/config/filterConfig.ts` - Updated labels to Danish
- `src/components/MobileFilterOverlay.tsx` - Use config instead of database
- Deleted 11 files in `src/components/mobile-filters/`
- Added `src/lib/__tests__/filter-mappings.test.ts`

### Next Steps for Continuation
- Monitor production to ensure filters work correctly
- Consider adding e2e tests for filter functionality
- May want to add analytics to track filter usage patterns

### Testing Notes
- All unit tests pass
- Manually verify on localhost that:
  - Mobile shows only 4 fuel types (Elektrisk, Benzin, Diesel, Hybrid)
  - Desktop shows same 4 options
  - Selecting "Benzin" actually finds cars with "Petrol" fuel type
  - Selecting "Hybrid" finds all hybrid variants

### Commit Reference
- `fcf0944` - fix: correct fuel type and body type filter mappings
