# Ground Shadow Implementation Summary - 2025-08-05

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented realistic ground shadows for car images in the Python image processing service.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Shadow Functions (`image_processing/shadow.py`)
- **`add_ground_shadow()`** - Single elliptical shadow beneath car
- **`add_dual_ground_shadow()`** - Two elliptical shadows under wheels

### 2. Shadow Features
- **Elliptical shape** instead of car silhouette
- **Minimal offset** (0, 3) - shadow directly below car
- **Higher blur** (35px) for soft, realistic edges
- **Radial gradient** - 70% opacity at center, fading to 0% at edges
- **Smart positioning** - Automatically detects car's bottom edge

### 3. Service Updates
- Added `ShadowType` enum (drop/ground/dual_ground)
- Updated `ImageOptions` model with ground shadow parameters
- Modified `app.py` to route to appropriate shadow function
- Set ground shadow as default for car mode

### 4. Edge Function Updates
- Updated `remove-bg` to specify `shadow_type: 'ground'`
- Deployed to production

## Visual Improvements

### Before (Drop Shadow)
```
    Car
     ╱
   ╱ Shadow (offset 10,10)
```

### After (Ground Shadow)
```
    Car
━━━━━━━━━━━  (elliptical shadow directly below)
```

## Parameters

### Ground Shadow (Default)
- Height: 15% of car height
- Width: 90% of car width
- Blur: 35px
- Opacity: 70% center → 0% edge

### Dual Ground Shadow (Optional)
- Two smaller ellipses under wheels
- Spacing: 60% of car width
- Size: 25% of car width each

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Python service updated (Railway auto-deploy from GitHub)
- ✅ Edge Function deployed to production
- ✅ Default shadow type changed to ground

## Testing
You can test the new shadow by uploading car images via:
- Admin interface: `/admin/listings`
- Direct Edge Function call

The ground shadow creates a more realistic appearance, making cars look like they're sitting on a surface rather than floating.

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Fine-tune shadow parameters based on user feedback
- Add surface color options (slight blue tint for outdoor)
- Implement automatic wheel detection for precise dual shadows
