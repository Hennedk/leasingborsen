# Shadow Functionality Removal Complete - 2025-08-05

## Summary

Successfully removed all custom shadow functionality from the image processing pipeline. Shadows are now exclusively applied through API4AI during background removal.

## Changes Made

### 1. Python Service (railway-pdfplumber-poc)
- ✅ Removed custom shadow application logic from `app.py`
- ✅ Removed shadow function imports (`add_drop_shadow`, `add_ground_shadow`, `add_dual_ground_shadow`)
- ✅ Cleaned up `models.py` to remove `ShadowType` enum and shadow parameters
- ✅ Updated health check to remove "drop_shadow" from features list

### 2. Edge Function (remove-bg)
- ✅ Updated to always use API shadow when background removal is enabled
- ✅ Deployed to production

### 3. Behavior Changes
- **Before**: Shadows could be applied with or without background removal
- **After**: Shadows ONLY applied when background removal is enabled (via API4AI)

## Current System Behavior

1. **With Background Removal**: 
   - `remove_background: true, add_shadow: true` → API shadow applied
   - `remove_background: true, add_shadow: false` → No shadow (API called without shadow mode)

2. **Without Background Removal**:
   - `remove_background: false, add_shadow: true` → NO shadow applied (request ignored)
   - `remove_background: false, add_shadow: false` → No shadow

## Testing

Created comprehensive test (`test-shadow-only-with-bg-removal.js`) to verify:
- Shadows only apply with background removal
- No custom shadows are applied
- API shadow integration works correctly

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Edge Function deployed to production
- ⚠️ Python service changes committed but not pushed (git authentication issue)
- Need to manually trigger Railway deployment or wait for auto-deploy

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Pipeline**: Single shadow implementation via API
2. **Consistent Results**: API-optimized shadows for automotive imagery
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Less code to maintain
4. **Better Performance**: No separate shadow processing step

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Railway deployment to ensure Python service updates are live
2. Verify shadow behavior in production after deployment
3. Update any documentation that references custom shadow options

The shadow functionality has been successfully simplified to use only API4AI's integrated shadow feature during background removal.
