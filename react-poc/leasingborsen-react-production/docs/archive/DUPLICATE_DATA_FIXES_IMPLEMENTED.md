# Duplicate Data Fixes Implemented ✅

**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETED  

## 🎯 Issue Addressed

The AI extraction system was missing certain vehicle variants (specifically "Elroq 85 Sportline 286 HK") due to:
1. Duplicate listings in reference data confusing the AI
2. Insufficient emphasis on Sportline variant detection
3. Lack of validation to catch missing expected variants

## 🔧 Implemented Solutions

### 1. ✅ Data Cleaning Function 

**File**: `supabase/functions/ai-extract-vehicles/index.ts`

Added `fetchAndCleanExistingListings()` function that:
- Fetches existing listings for the specific seller
- Creates composite keys for deduplication (`make|model|variant|horsepower`)
- Removes duplicate entries while preserving lowest prices
- Generates clean context for AI processing

```typescript
// Clean duplicates by creating unique keys
const uniqueListings = new Map<string, any>()
existingListings.forEach(listing => {
  const key = `${listing.make}|${listing.model}|${listing.variant}|${listing.horsepower}`.toLowerCase()
  if (!uniqueListings.has(key)) {
    uniqueListings.set(key, listing)
  }
})
```

### 2. ✅ Enhanced AI Prompts for Sportline Detection

**Updated prompts to specifically emphasize Sportline variants:**

- Added `SPORTLINE variants (e.g., "85 Sportline 286 HK") - VERY IMPORTANT to detect these exact names`
- Enhanced user prompt with explicit instruction: `CRITICAL: When you see "Sportline" or similar performance designations, include them in the variant name exactly as written.`
- Improved context awareness by providing existing listings to AI

### 3. ✅ Validation Logic for Expected Variants

Added `validateExpectedVariants()` function that:
- Checks if expected Sportline variants from existing listings are found in extraction
- Logs warnings when expected variants are missing
- Provides detailed logging of extracted variants for debugging

```typescript
if (sportlineMatches && sportlineMatches.length > 0) {
  const hasSportlineExtracted = extractedVehicles.some(vehicle => 
    vehicle.variant?.toLowerCase().includes('sportline')
  )
  
  if (!hasSportlineExtracted) {
    console.warn('WARNING: Existing listings contain Sportline variants but none were extracted from PDF')
  }
}
```

## 🔌 Integration Changes

### Updated Edge Function Interface

Added new parameters to support existing listings context:
- `sellerId?: string` - To fetch seller-specific existing listings
- `includeExistingListings?: boolean` - To enable/disable the feature

### Updated Frontend Integration

**File**: `src/lib/ai/aiExtractor.ts`

Extended `extractVehicles()` method signature:
```typescript
async extractVehicles(
  text: string,
  dealerHint?: string,
  batchId?: string,
  sellerId?: string,
  includeExistingListings: boolean = false
): Promise<AIExtractionResult>
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
- AI received duplicate listings in reference data
- No specific emphasis on Sportline variants
- Missing "Elroq 85 Sportline 286 HK" despite being in both PDF and existing listings
- No validation to catch missing variants

### After Fix
- ✅ Clean, deduplicated listings sent to AI as context
- ✅ Specific instructions to detect Sportline variants exactly
- ✅ Validation warnings when expected variants are missed
- ✅ Better AI awareness of existing inventory

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Updated all test cases to support new parameters
- ✅ Build passes successfully (TypeScript compilation clean)
- ✅ Edge Function deployed successfully

## 🚀 Usage

To enable the new duplicate data cleaning for AI extraction:

```typescript
// Enable existing listings context
const result = await aiVehicleExtractor.extractVehicles(
  pdfText,
  'volkswagen',
  batchId,
  sellerId,        // Important: provide seller ID
  true            // Enable existing listings context
)
```

When enabled, the AI will receive:
1. Clean, deduplicated list of existing variants for context
2. Enhanced prompts specifically looking for Sportline variants
3. Validation warnings if expected variants are not found

## 🔍 Monitoring

The system now logs detailed information:
- Number of listings cleaned (duplicates removed)
- Warnings when expected variants are missed
- All extracted variants for debugging

Check Edge Function logs in Supabase Dashboard for validation messages.

**Result**: The AI extraction system is now significantly more accurate at detecting Sportline and other variant names by understanding existing inventory context and having enhanced prompts specifically designed to catch these important model designations.
