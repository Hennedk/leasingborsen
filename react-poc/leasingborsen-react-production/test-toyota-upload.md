# Toyota PDF Upload Testing Guide

## Testing Setup Complete ✅

### System Status:
- **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:5174/
- **Edge Function**: Deployed and healthy (process-pdf)
- **Supabase**: Connected
- **Build**: Successful ✅

### Toyota Upload Testing Steps:

1. **Access Admin Sellers Page**:
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:5174/admin/sellers
   - Look for the sellers list

2. **Test Toyota Upload**:
   - Click on any seller to access their details
   - Find the "Batch Upload" or upload button
   - Select "Toyota / Lexus" as dealer type (instead of auto-detect)
   - Upload the `VolkswagenLeasingpriser.pdf` file as a test
   - The system should extract text client-side and process it server-side

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - PDF text extraction should work (using pdfjs-dist)
   - Text should be sent to Edge Function for processing
   - Server should attempt to detect dealer type or use selected "Toyota"
   - Processing should complete without CORS errors

### Files Available for Testing:
- `VolkswagenLeasingpriser.pdf` (67KB)
- `VolkswagenLeasingpriser-3.pdf` (170KB)

### System Architecture:
- **Client-side**: PDF text extraction using PDF.js
- **Server-side**: Text processing with Toyota dealer configuration
- **Edge Function**: `process-pdf` deployed on Supabase

### Key Changes Made:
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- Resolved CORS issues with Edge Function
- Implemented Option 2 (client-side extraction + server processing)
- Added Toyota dealer configuration
- Created switch UI component
- Temporarily disabled problematic processing components

### Next Steps:
The user can now test Toyota PDF upload functionality by:
1. Opening http://localhost:5174/admin/sellers in browser
2. Following the upload steps above
3. Selecting Toyota as dealer type
4. Testing with available PDF files
