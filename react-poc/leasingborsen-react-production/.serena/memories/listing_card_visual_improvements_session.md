## Date: 2025-01-09

## Objectives Completed
1. ✅ Improved visual balance of listing cards
2. ✅ Reduced LeaseScore badge size to prevent overlap
3. ✅ Adjusted image container spacing
4. ✅ Fixed LeaseScore sorting on mobile

## Changes Made

### 1. LeaseScore Badge Improvements
- **Added new 'xs' size variant** to LeaseScorePill component
  - 30px diameter (17% smaller than 'sm')
  - Smaller text sizes (10px labels)
  - Tighter padding for compact appearance
- **Updated badge in ListingCard**
  - Changed from size="sm" to size="xs"
  - Repositioned from top-4 right-4 to top-3 right-3

### 2. Image Container Spacing Adjustments
- **Progressive padding increases** to prevent badge-car overlap:
  - Initial: p-4 (uniform 16px)
  - First adjustment: px-4 pt-7 pb-5 (28px top, 20px bottom)
  - Second adjustment: px-4 pt-10 pb-5 (40px top)
  - Third adjustment: px-4 pt-12 pb-5 (48px top)
  - Final adjustment: px-4 pt-14 pb-8 (56px top, 32px bottom)
- Creates dedicated space for badge without overlapping car image
- Better visual balance with more breathing room

### 3. Mobile LeaseScore Sorting Fix
- **Fixed MobileFilterOverlay.tsx**:
  - Added 'Bedste værdi' option to mobileSelectOptions array
  - Updated mapToBackendSort function to handle 'lease_score_desc'
  - Updated mapToSelectValue function to handle 'lease_score_desc'
- Mobile users can now sort by LeaseScore just like desktop users
