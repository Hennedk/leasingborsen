# Session 2025-08-26: Viewport Jumping Fix & Mobile Image UX

## Session Summary

Fixed two critical UX issues in the Danish car leasing comparison platform:

### Issue 1: Viewport Jumping on Filter Changes
**Problem**: When applying or removing filters on `/listings` page, the viewport would jump instead of staying in the same position, contradicting the expanding effect from an information perspective.

**Root Cause**: 
- `useListingsScrollRestoration` hook was restoring scroll positions for every filter combination
- No distinction between filter changes vs navigation events
- Each unique filter state had its own saved scroll position

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Modified `useUrlSync.ts`**: Added filter change context tracking with timestamps in sessionStorage
- **Enhanced `useListingsScrollRestoration.ts`**: Added logic to skip scroll restoration during filter operations
- **Preserved Navigation**: Normal back/forward navigation still works with scroll restoration

**Files Changed**:
- `src/hooks/useUrlSync.ts` - Filter change detection and context storage  
- `src/hooks/useListingsScrollRestoration.ts` - Skip restoration on filter changes
- `src/index.css` - Added reduced motion accessibility support

**Commit**: `fix: prevent viewport jumping when applying/removing filters on listings page`

### Issue 2: Mobile Car Image Size Inconsistency  
**Problem**: Car images appeared smaller on detail pages than on listing cards, breaking the "expansion" UX metaphor.

**Root Cause**:
- Listing cards: 4:3 aspect ratio (taller format)
- Detail page mobile hero: 16:9 aspect ratio (wider but shorter)
- Different padding values between components

**Solution Implemented** (Option 1 - Quick Fix):
- **Changed aspect ratio**: MobileHeroImage from 16:9 to 4:3
- **Aligned padding**: Updated to match ListingCard spacing (`px-4 pt-14 pb-8`)
- **Visual consistency**: Car images now maintain same or larger size on detail pages

**File Changed**:
- `src/components/listing/MobileHeroImage.tsx` - Aspect ratio and padding updates

**Commit**: `fix: improve mobile car image sizing for consistent expansion UX`

### Page Transition UX Improvements (Phase 1)
**Problem**: Navigation felt "too snappy" and jarring between pages.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced timing**: Increased transition from 150ms to 280ms
- **Organic easing**: Added `cubic-bezier(0.22,0.61,0.36,1)` for natural feel
- **Subtle animations**: Added 2% scale effects (exit scale-down, enter scale-up)
- **Performance optimized**: GPU-accelerated transforms with proper willChange hints
- **Accessibility**: Full support for `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Files Changed**:
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` - Enhanced PageTransition component
- `src/index.css` - Reduced motion accessibility rules

**Commit**: `feat: improve page transition UX with refined timing and subtle animations`

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Scroll Restoration Pattern
- Uses sessionStorage with timestamps for reliable filter change detection
- 1-second timeout window for filter change context
- Maintains zero input latency - navigation fires immediately

### Mobile Image Sizing
- 4:3 aspect ratio creates visual parity with listing cards
- Proper "expansion" feel reinforces information hierarchy
- Consistent padding ensures proper car image sizing

### Page Transitions
- 280ms duration hits sweet spot between responsive and smooth
- Transform/opacity for 60fps GPU acceleration
- 140ms overlap prevents content flash during transitions

## Development Environment
- **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:5174/
- **Build Status**: All changes build successfully without errors
- **Testing**: Manual testing confirmed all fixes work as expected

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Test on various mobile devices** - Verify image sizing across different screen sizes
2. **User feedback collection** - Gather feedback on transition timings and feel
3. **Consider Phase 2 enhancements**: 
   - Shared element transitions for car images
   - Progressive loading states
   - Enhanced micro-interactions

## Files Modified This Session
- `src/hooks/useUrlSync.ts`
- `src/hooks/useListingsScrollRestoration.ts` 
- `src/index.css`
- `src/routes/__root.tsx`
- `src/components/listing/MobileHeroImage.tsx`

All changes focused on UX improvements with minimal performance impact and full accessibility support.
