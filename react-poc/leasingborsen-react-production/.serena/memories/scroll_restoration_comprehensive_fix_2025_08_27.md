# Scroll Restoration Comprehensive Fix - August 27, 2025

## Issue Resolved
Fixed intermittent scroll restoration failures when navigating back from `/listing` to `/listings` pages. The issue had no clear pattern and would sometimes work, sometimes scroll to top instead of restoring position.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem was caused by multiple competing systems that could interfere with each other:

1. **Inconsistent Back Navigation Detection**: Multiple detection methods (Performance API, Navigation API, sessionStorage) didn't always agree
2. **Race Conditions**: Save/restore operations could overwrite good scroll positions
3. **Storage System Conflicts**: Dual storage locations with inconsistent formats
4. **Filter Change Interference**: Filter changes confused with back navigation events

## Technical Solution

### Enhanced Back Navigation Detection
- Added Navigation API support with `navigation.currentEntry` checks
- Enhanced Performance API detection with `PerformanceNavigationTiming` typing
- Improved sessionStorage flag validation with extended time windows (5s)
- Added comprehensive debug logging for detection decision tracking

### Race Condition Prevention  
- Extended restoration window protection (300ms → 1000ms)
- Increased scroll save debounce time (100ms → 200ms)
- Enhanced mount time protection (500ms → 1000ms)
- Added `isRestoringRef` for better restoration state tracking

### Consolidated Storage System
- Unified JSON storage format: `{position, timestamp, version, source, navigationType}`
- Backward compatibility maintained for legacy number format
- Enhanced storage with navigation type tracking (`prepare` vs `scroll`)
- Consistent normalization across both navigation hooks

### Filter vs Navigation Detection
- Added source tracking for filter changes (`user-filter-change` vs `url-sync-complete`)
- Enhanced pathname validation (only `/listings` can trigger filter changes)
- Extended freshness window (1s → 2s) for async operations
- Automatic cleanup of filter context on confirmed back navigation

## Files Modified
1. `src/hooks/useListingsScrollRestoration.ts` - Core scroll restoration logic
2. `src/hooks/useNavigationContext.ts` - Navigation state management  
3. `src/hooks/useUrlSync.ts` - Filter change context tracking

## Debug Logging Added
- Navigation type detection with reasoning (`[ScrollRestore] Navigation type:`)
- Save/restore operations with timestamps (`[ScrollRestore] Saved position:`)
- Filter change validation (`[ScrollRestore] Filter change check:`)
- Storage consolidation tracking (`[ScrollRestore] Found consolidated storage data:`)

## Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Build completes successfully (449KB JS, 138KB CSS)
- ✅ All modified files ESLint clean
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

## Next Developer Actions
1. Monitor production console logs for `[ScrollRestore]` messages
2. Test edge cases after deployment
3. Remove debug logging once confirmed working
4. The fix should work consistently now with better detection and protection mechanisms

## Key Improvement
The scroll restoration now uses multiple fallback detection methods and prevents race conditions that were causing the intermittent failures. The consolidated storage format provides better debugging capability and future extensibility.
