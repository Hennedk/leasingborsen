# Session 2025-08-16: Listing Page Layout & UX Improvements

## Duration
~3 hours

## Main Focus
Complete redesign of the listing page layout and price calculator interface with focus on UX improvements and visual hierarchy.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Column Layout Optimization
- **Changed listing page layout** from 2/1 (66.6%/33.3%) to 65%/35% split
- **Improved balance** between content and sidebar areas
- **Maintained responsive design** with mobile single-column layout

### 2. KeySpecs Component Enhancement
- **Implemented 4-column grid** layout on desktop for better space utilization
- **Maintained 2-column layout** on mobile for touch-friendly interface
- **Improved visual organization** of car specifications

### 3. Price Calculator Integration & Redesign
- **Moved car title** (make, model, variant) into price calculator component
- **Integrated CTA button** ("Se tilbud hos leasingselskab") into calculator
- **Created 3-section visual hierarchy**:
  - Section 1: Car information (24px gap)
  - Section 2: Price + configuration dropdowns (12px internal gap)
  - Section 3: CTA button (24px gap)
- **Removed redundant elements** from sidebar for cleaner layout

### 4. Grouped Dropdowns with Airbnb-Style Design
- **Implemented shared borders** for price configuration dropdowns
- **Created unified white container** with dividers between sections
- **Increased dropdown height** to 66px for better touch targets
- **Removed uppercase styling** from labels for better readability
- **Added proper spacing** and visual grouping

### 5. Smart Dropdown Behavior Implementation
- **Single option dropdowns**: Show as read-only fields without arrow
- **Multiple option dropdowns**: Show interactive with "X muligheder" indicator
- **Conditional rendering** based on available options count
- **Maintained all price impact functionality**

### 6. Typography & Visual Hierarchy Improvements
- **Changed dropdown headers** from grey to black for better contrast
- **Reduced font size** of dropdown values for better hierarchy
- **Removed redundant "Nuværende" labels** from dropdown options
- **Show "Nuværende" instead of "Samme pris"** for current selections

## Session Notes
The session successfully transformed the listing page from a traditional separated layout to a modern, integrated design. The price calculator now serves as a complete action center combining car information, pricing, configuration, and conversion elements. The smart dropdown behavior provides appropriate affordances based on available options, reducing interface clutter while maintaining full functionality.

All changes maintain backward compatibility and preserve existing functionality while significantly improving the user experience and visual design.
