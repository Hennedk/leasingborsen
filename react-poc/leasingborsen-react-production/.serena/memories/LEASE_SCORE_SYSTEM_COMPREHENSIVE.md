# Comprehensive Lease Score System Understanding

## Executive Summary
The Leasingborsen platform features an intelligent lease score system that evaluates car leasing offers on a 0-100 scale. The system analyzes three key dimensions - monthly payment rate, mileage allowance, and contract flexibility - to help Danish consumers identify the best leasing deals. Each listing can have multiple pricing options, with the system automatically selecting the best-scoring offer.

## Core Algorithm

### Weighted Scoring Formula
```
Total Score = (Monthly Rate Score Ã— 45%) + (Mileage Score Ã— 35%) + (Flexibility Score Ã— 20%)
```

### Component Details

#### 1. Monthly Rate Score (45% weight)
- **Metric**: Monthly payment as percentage of retail price
- **Logic**: Lower percentage = better value = higher score
- **Scoring bands**:
  - < 0.9% of retail price: 100 points (exceptional)
  - 0.9-1.1%: 90 points (excellent)
  - 1.1-1.3%: 80 points (very good)
  - 1.3-1.5%: 70 points (good)
  - 1.5-1.7%: 60 points (fair)
  - 1.7-1.9%: 50 points (below average)
  - 1.9-2.1%: 40 points (poor)
  - > 2.1%: 25 points (very poor)

#### 2. Mileage Score (35% weight)
- **Metric**: Annual mileage allowance normalized to 15,000 km baseline
- **Logic**: More mileage = better value = higher score
- **Scoring bands**:
  - â‰¥ 25,000 km/year: 100 points
  - â‰¥ 20,000 km/year: 90 points
  - â‰¥ 15,000 km/year: 75 points (baseline)
  - â‰¥ 12,000 km/year: 55 points
  - â‰¥ 10,000 km/year: 35 points
  - < 10,000 km/year: 20 points

#### 3. Flexibility Score (20% weight)
- **Metric**: Contract term length
- **Logic**: Shorter terms = more flexibility = higher score
- **Scoring bands**:
  - â‰¤ 12 months: 100 points
  - â‰¤ 24 months: 90 points
  - â‰¤ 36 months: 75 points
  - â‰¤ 48 months: 55 points
  - > 48 months: 30 points

## Multi-Offer Processing

### How It Works
1. Each listing can have multiple `lease_pricing` records (different offers)
2. System calculates score for each pricing option
3. Selects the highest-scoring offer as the listing's official score
4. Stores both the total score and the winning offer's `pricing_id`

### Example Scenario
A BMW 3 Series with retail price 400,000 kr has three lease offers:
- Offer A: 3,600 kr/month, 15,000 km/year, 36 months â†’ Score: 75
- Offer B: 4,000 kr/month, 20,000 km/year, 24 months â†’ Score: 82
- Offer C: 3,200 kr/month, 10,000 km/year, 48 months â†’ Score: 68

Result: Listing shows score of 82 (Offer B wins)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Fields in listings table
retail_price NUMERIC(10, 2)              -- Required for calculation
lease_score INTEGER (0-100)              -- Calculated score
lease_score_calculated_at TIMESTAMPTZ    -- Last calculation time
lease_score_breakdown JSONB              -- Detailed breakdown

-- Breakdown JSON structure
{
  "totalScore": 85,
  "monthlyRateScore": 90,
  "monthlyRatePercent": 1.05,
  "mileageScore": 83,
  "mileageNormalized": 1.33,
  "flexibilityScore": 75,
  "pricingId": "uuid-of-winning-offer",
  "calculation_version": "1.0"
}
```

- **Features**:
  - Color-coded badges (green/yellow/red)
  - Tooltip with detailed breakdown
  - Stale indicator (>7 days old)

    breakdown?: LeaseScoreBreakdown
    calculatedAt?: string
    retailPrice?: number
    showTooltip?: boolean
    size?: 'sm' | 'default'
  }
  ```

#### `useBulkLeaseScoreCalculation` Hook
- **Location**: `/src/hooks/useBulkLeaseScoreCalculation.ts`
- **Purpose**: Trigger bulk score calculations from admin UI
- **Features**:
  - Filters listings with retail prices
  - Calls batch Edge Function
  - Invalidates React Query cache
  - Shows success/error toasts
  - Logs detailed error results

## Visual Indicators & UX

### Score Ranges
- **80-100**: ðŸŸ¢ Premium value (green badge)
- **60-79**: ðŸŸ¡ Good value (yellow badge)
- **40-59**: ðŸ”´ Fair value (red badge)
- **0-39**: ðŸ”´ Poor value (red badge)
- **No score**: âšª Missing prerequisites (gray badge)

### Staleness Detection
- Scores older than 7 days show clock icon
- Automatic detection when price/terms change
- Database triggers mark scores for recalculation

## Business Logic & Rules

### Prerequisites for Calculation
1. Listing must have `retail_price` (not null)
2. At least one `lease_pricing` record must exist
3. All pricing fields must be valid (positive numbers)

### Automatic Recalculation Triggers
- Retail price changes
- Lease pricing updated
- New pricing option added
- Pricing option deleted
- Manual force recalculation

### Error Handling
- Missing retail price â†’ Skip, show "Mangler detailpris"
- No pricing options â†’ Skip, show "Ikke beregnet"
- Calculation errors â†’ Log and continue with next listing
- Invalid data â†’ Return validation error message

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Level
- Indexed columns: `lease_score`, `retail_price`
- Scores cached in `listings` table
- `full_listing_view` includes all score fields
- Batch processing limits (50-100 listings)

### Frontend Level
- React Query caching with automatic invalidation
- Memoized score badge rendering
- Lazy loading for tooltip content
- Optimistic UI updates during calculation

### Query Patterns
```sql
-- High-value deals
SELECT * FROM full_listing_view 
WHERE lease_score >= 80 
ORDER BY lease_score DESC;

-- Stale scores needing recalculation
SELECT listing_id FROM listings 
WHERE lease_score_calculated_at < updated_at
OR (retail_price IS NOT NULL AND lease_score IS NULL);

-- Dealer average scores
SELECT seller_id, AVG(lease_score) as avg_score
FROM listings
WHERE lease_score IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY seller_id;
```

## Admin Interface Integration

### Bulk Actions
1. Select listings in admin table
2. Click "Beregn Leasing Score"
3. System filters for listings with retail prices
4. Calls batch Edge Function
5. Updates UI with results
6. Shows toast with success/error counts

### Individual Updates
- Automatic on listing save if retail price exists
- Manual trigger via action menu
- Real-time score preview in edit modal

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Score Not Showing"
- **Causes**: Missing retail price, no pricing records, calculation failed
- **Solutions**: Add retail price, verify pricing data, check Edge Function logs

### "Incorrect Score"
- **Causes**: Wrong pricing data, outdated algorithm, data integrity issues
- **Solutions**: Verify source data, force recalculation, check breakdown details

### "Bulk Calculation Fails"
- **Causes**: Too many listings, timeout, database connection issues
- **Solutions**: Process smaller batches, increase timeout, check Supabase status

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

1. **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Allow customization of component weights
2. **Market-Based Scoring**: Compare against market averages
3. **Historical Tracking**: Score trends over time
4. **Personalized Scoring**: User preference-based adjustments
5. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare dealer scores
6. **API Exposure**: Public API for score calculations
