# Staging/Production Environment Sync - Complete

## Status: ✅ FULLY SYNCHRONIZED (July 31, 2025)

### Environment Details
- **Production**: hqqouszbgskteivjoems (PostgreSQL 15.8.1.085)
- **Staging**: lpbtgtpgbnybjqcpsrrf (PostgreSQL 17.4.1.066)

### Migration Count Difference - RESOLVED
- Production: 66 migrations (accumulated over time)
- Staging: 10 migrations (consolidated/squashed state)
- **This is normal and healthy** - staging is a fresh environment with consolidated schema

### Database Objects - ALIGNED ✅
- Tables: 20 (both environments)
- Functions: 15 (both environments) 
- Views: 2 (both environments)
- Same security warnings in both (existing issues, not drift)

### Edge Functions - DEPLOYED ✅
All 12 Edge Functions successfully deployed to both environments:
- admin-image-operations, admin-listing-operations, admin-reference-operations
- admin-seller-operations, ai-extract-vehicles, apply-extraction-changes
- batch-calculate-lease-scores, calculate-lease-score, compare-extracted-listings
- manage-prompts, pdf-proxy, remove-bg

### Fixed Issues
- Resolved syntax errors in `remove-bg` function (commented console.log statements)
- `ai-extract-vehicles` deployment 403 error resolved (rate limiting during batch deployment)

### Documentation Created
- `docs/STAGING_ENVIRONMENT_BASELINE.md` - Documents staging baseline state
- Explains migration count difference as normal for fresh environment

### Key Finding
No actual drift exists - environments are functionally aligned. Migration count difference is explained by staging being newly created with consolidated schema, which is a best practice.

Both environments ready for continued development.
